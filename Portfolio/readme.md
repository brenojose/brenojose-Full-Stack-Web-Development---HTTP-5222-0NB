# Portfolio

Steps to run the project:
```
1- Download the repo
2- install all dependencies ( npm install )
3- Copy the backend folder "Joanna" inside C:/htdocs
4- Import portfolio.sql (inside backend folder) to your MySQL localhost database ( MAMP Preferable )
5- Run "npm run dev"
```

Notes:
- I spent a lot of time working on the front-end part, so my back-end at this present moment is just a basic php json as choice 1 mentioned, I'll keep working on this project even after the duedate. The last part of the website shows a blog feature which I want to create in the future but for now is just random fictional content.
